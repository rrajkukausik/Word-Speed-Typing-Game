# Word-Speed-Typing-Game
It is a game designed to improve QWERTY typing rate and efficiency. Words appear one by one at a rate that goes up as time progresses. There’s a limited “stack space” that fills up after a certain amount of words have appeared. Once a player types a word correctly, that word is removed from the stack. The score is calculated based on how fast the player was able to clear that word, and a multiplier. The multiplier increases with every word the player types correctly and resets on any mistype. Optionally a leveling system can also be added that varies the word appearing rate, the stack space and leveling up bonus score, else the rate can go up constantly, flattening out at say one word per two seconds. If the stack is full, it’s game over. The player can then submit their score and compare with a leaderboard.
